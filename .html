How to get the files

A word about getting the configuration files: when enabling a MangoHud preset, SteamOS will write a temporary file in /tmp which will be named mangohud.XXXXXXXX (XXXXXXXX being a random sequence of alphanumeric characters).

By activating all the presets and then exploring the /tmp folder from Desktop mode, it is possible to recover all the configuration files.
MangoHud config files

If you want to reuse the configuration files as they are, you can remove the fsr_steam_sharpness and nis_steam_sharpness statements which are specific to the Steam Deck (or more precisely to Gamescope, the compositor which allows the Steam Deck to make use of FSR).

In order to configure MangoHud on another computer, you will just need to put the content of one of the presets in the file ~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf so that MangoHud finds the configuration. In the case of Steam games, don’t forget to set the game launch command to mangohud %command%.
Preset 0 (disabled)

This preset disables MangoHud.

no_display

Preset 1

This preset only displays the FPS counter.

control=mangohud
fsr_steam_sharpness=5
nis_steam_sharpness=10
frame_timing=0
cpu_stats=0
gpu_stats=0
fps=1
fps_only
legacy_layout=0
width=40
frametime=0

Preset 2

This preset displays a horizontal performance summary. This is the setting I use the most, it is not very intrusive while displaying the most important information.

control=mangohud
fsr_steam_sharpness=5
nis_steam_sharpness=10
legacy_layout=0
horizontal
battery
gpu_stats
cpu_stats
cpu_power
gpu_power
ram
fps
frametime=0
hud_no_margin
table_columns=14
frame_timing=1

Preset 3

This is the “normal” preset, which remains compact while showing more information than the previous preset (especially the temperatures).

control=mangohud
fsr_steam_sharpness=5
nis_steam_sharpness=10
cpu_temp
gpu_temp
ram
vram
io_read
io_write
arch
gpu_name
cpu_power
gpu_power
wine
frametime
battery

Preset 4

This preset is the most complete but it is also the most intrusive.

control=mangohud
fsr_steam_sharpness=5
nis_steam_sharpness=10
full
cpu_temp
gpu_temp
ram
vram
io_read
io_write
